# FarmerSync Data Preprocessing Summary
**Group Assignment #3 - Computing Intelligence & Application**

## Project Overview
**FarmerSync – Cooperative Management and Stock Tracking System**
- **Dataset:** Climate data (8 districts), tomato prices, harvest records
- **Objective:** Apply 6 core preprocessing techniques for agricultural AI

## Preprocessing Techniques Applied

### 1. Data Cleaning ✅
**Purpose:** Handle missing values, duplicates, inconsistent data
- **Applied:** Replaced sensor error codes (-999.0) with NaN
- **Method:** Median imputation for numerical features
- **Result:** Eliminated all missing values across 8 climate datasets
- **Impact:** Improved data quality for reliable model training

### 2. Data Integration ✅
**Purpose:** Merge multiple data sources into unified dataset
- **Applied:** Combined 8 district climate files + tomato prices + harvest data
- **Method:** Date-based merging with left joins
- **Result:** Single comprehensive dataset with all agricultural variables
- **Impact:** Enabled cross-regional analysis and comprehensive modeling

### 3. Data Reduction ✅
**Purpose:** Select most relevant features, reduce dimensionality
- **Applied:** Correlation analysis to identify key climate variables
- **Method:** Feature selection based on correlation with crop prices
- **Result:** Reduced from 10+ columns to 5-7 essential features
- **Impact:** Improved computational efficiency while retaining predictive power

### 4. Data Transformation ✅
**Purpose:** Normalize and encode data for machine learning
- **Applied:** Min-Max scaling for numerical features, label encoding for locations
- **Method:** StandardScaler for climate variables, LabelEncoder for districts
- **Result:** All features scaled to [0,1] range, categorical variables encoded
- **Impact:** Ensured fair contribution of all features in ML algorithms

### 5. Data Discretization ✅
**Purpose:** Convert continuous variables into discrete categories
- **Applied:** Temperature and rainfall categorization
- **Method:** Domain-knowledge based binning (Cold/Cool/Moderate/Warm/Hot)
- **Result:** Created categorical weather conditions for decision rules
- **Impact:** Enabled rule-based agricultural recommendations

### 6. Data Augmentation ✅
**Purpose:** Generate additional synthetic data samples
- **Applied:** Gaussian noise addition and interpolation techniques
- **Method:** 3% noise factor + interpolation between consecutive records
- **Result:** Increased dataset size by 150%+ 
- **Impact:** Enhanced model robustness and generalization capability
